# Transfer Learning using Keras InceptionV3 Model to classify dog faces

__(This is still under MAJOR construction)__

# Usage
1. run_app.py is the main flask app that we need to run the web application.
2. Other py. files serve as modules for run_app.py
3. The user interactive code is predict.html. You can access it within __static__ folder.
4. I am still in the process of figuring out how to run it on either Google Cloud or AWS.
